# Misc Versions
## C3 Supermini edition
The C3 Supermini is significantly smaller than a D1 Mini, allowing for a 9mm reduction of the total width (50mm vs 59mm). This version is 14500 only, since it's designed to be as small as possible.

The C3 Supermini's antenna is very bad, so this version is not viable unless you have a decent router within a few meters of your playspace. There is a new version of the C3 Supermini with an external antenna connector that can drastically improve signal strength, but I haven't yet tested it so try at your own risk.
