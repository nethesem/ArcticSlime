# Misc Versions
## XL (18650) edition
The XL version has extended tabs to accomodate an 18650 footprint. This can be useful as the 18650 cell can offer very high capacity (up to 3000mAh) for exceptionally long run time. The 18650 is also an extremely common Li-ion cell, purchasable from many places and also easy to scavage from old laptop batteries and powerbanks, making it a great candidate if you simply cannot get other Li-ion / Li-po cells.

Note that the 18650, along with being physically large, will also be noticably heavier than other cells, which can affect stability.

## C3 Supermini edition
The C3 Supermini is significantly smaller than a D1 Mini, allowing for a 9mm reduction of the total width (50mm vs 59mm). This version is 14500 only, since it's designed to be as small as possible.

The C3 Supermini's antenna is very bad, so this version is not viable unless you have a decent router within a few meters of your playspace. There is a new version of the C3 Supermini with an external antenna connector that can drastically improve signal strength, but I haven't yet tested it so try at your own risk.
